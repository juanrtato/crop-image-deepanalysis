## Overview

This project proposes a solution based on a **multimodal pipeline** that translates the visual outputs of **semantic segmentation models** into interpretable inputs for **large language models (LLMs)**. The goal is to enable effective crop analysis and facilitate knowledge transfer between different agricultural regions.

By combining computer vision and natural language processing, this approach seeks to enhance the decision-making process in precision agriculture and bridge the gap between visual data interpretation and actionable insights.
